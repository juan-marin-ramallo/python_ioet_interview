My exercise solution use the nexts elements:

Use Classes and properties.
Use Design Patterns Singleton and Iterator.
Implements Unit Tests.
Manage Exceptions Handling.
Edge cases works correctly and minutes are managed if the time past 12h01 considering like extra hour for example.
The table of work hour salaries is not hardcoded. I use a json file to read this information.
Use modularization.
Weekdays are correctly validated.
Working with Dictionaries.
Reading a text file.
Working with datetime and timedelta.
Slicing.
Functions.
Iterations.
Splits.
Flow Control.


My main method is to iterate through each day worked for each employee, and for each day worked, then I iterate through each hour worked and check what range I have to use to calculate pay for that hour.
